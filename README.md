# 🏡 House Price Prediction System  

### 📌 Overview  
This project builds an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** for predicting house prices based on key property features such as **size, location, and condition**. By leveraging **MLOps best practices**, the system ensures **efficiency, scalability, and reproducibility** in model training and deployment.  

### 🚀 Key Features  
- **End-to-End ML Pipeline**: Covers data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and deployment.  
- **MLOps Integration**: Built with **ZenML** for streamlined ML workflow management.  
- **Experiment Tracking & Model Deployment**: Uses **MLflow** to monitor model performance and deployment.  
- **Feature Engineering & Optimization**: Extracts relevant features for **accurate price predictions**.  

### 🔧 Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch  
- **MLOps Framework**: ZenML  
- **Experiment Tracking & Deployment**: MLflow  
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  

### 📊 How It Works  
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares real estate data for analysis.  
2. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Uses ML algorithms to learn price patterns.  
3. **Experiment Tracking with MLflow**: Logs metrics, parameters, and performance.  
4. **Deployment with ZenML**: Automates model deployment for real-time predictions.  

### 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out  
- **Real-World Application**: Directly applicable in real estate pricing and investment analysis.  
- **Scalability & Automation**: Ensures smooth scaling from development to production.  
- **Recruiter-Friendly Code & Documentation**: Well-structured and easy to navigate.
